  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>
    From cold-pressed juices to grilled street corn and citrus-marinated proteins, everything is made fresh daily.
    We bring the sunbaked charm of the Mexican desert into a modern, elevated dining space.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the heart of the desert, there's a plant that thrives under the sun, stores water in its body, and nourishes those who know how to use it.
    That plant is the nopal cactus; it is the soul of our story.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nopalito was born from a deep appreciation for the natural simplicity and bold flavors found across Mexico's desert regions, from Oaxaca to Sonora.
    It is a love letter to fresh ingredients, vibrant culture, and the enduring spirit of resilience and hospitality that defines Mexican food.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our concept blends modern Mexican desert: clean, bold, honest.
    The interior evokes a warm desert sunset — terracotta walls, velvet textures, clay-toned lighting, and lush greenery tucked in like an oasis.
    The vibe is sultry yet light, grounding yet energizing.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Nopali, we offer more than just tacos and tequila.
    Our fresh juice program — with ingredients like cactus, pear, watermelon, lime, ginger, and hibiscus — serves as a central pillar of the menu.
    Just like the nopal cactus, our food and drink are designed to refresh, nourish, and invigorate.
    Nopalito is not just a place to eat; it is where people come to feel good, feel warm, and feel connected.
